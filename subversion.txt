svn merge -r 9:8 file:///~/r/trunk                      in working copy undo the changes done from 8th to 9th commit
svn move foo.c bar.c                                    rename foo.c into bar.c thereby keeping the ancestry

svn switch file:///~/repo/branches/1                    switch working copy to branch 1 in repo, assuming your working copy was of trunk or any other branch
svn update                                              update your working copy to reflect the current repo's state. no arguments means recurse down current dir

svnadmin create ~/repo                                  creates new repo (of which you can get a working copy later)
tag                                                     a branch that is supposed to be a static snapshot of repo. Should not be commited to by convention
tags                                                    by convention (though optional), the name for a directory in repo where all tags reside
trunk                                                   by convention (though optional), the name for a directory in repo where main development takes place

SCENARIO 1
You did couple commits in a branch and now you want them to merge into trunk:
cd ~/repo/trunk
svn update # to sync wc with repo
svn merge -r 7:HEAD file:///~/repo/branches/my-branch
svn commit -m "Merged my-branch changes into trunk"
To find from which revision you actually branched out, run while in ~/repo/branches/my-branch:
svn log --verbose --stop-on-copy
 
SCENARIO 2
In revision 808 you did a lot of changes to a lot of files and also deleted foo.c. Now you want to resurrect foo.c though keep
all the changes done to other files in revision 808. The run:
svn copy -r 808 file:///~/repo/trunk/foo.c ./foo.c
